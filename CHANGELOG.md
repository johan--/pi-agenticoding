## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Spawned child agents now inherit active registered parent tools executable in the child session, including MCP/extension tools such as ChunkHound when active and registered, while still excluding spawn and handoff and preserving child-local notebook tools.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Interactive `/ledger` TUI overlay** — replaced the static notification popup with a full interactive overlay. Use arrow keys to navigate entries, press Enter to preview a selected entry body (truncated at 500 chars with `...`), and Escape to close. Empty state shows a discoverability hint.
- **Visual handoff indicator** — when `/handoff` is invoked, a live `🤝 Handoff in progress` badge appears in the TUI status bar. Clears automatically when compaction completes, or when the agent finishes a turn without calling the handoff tool.
- **Ledger tool TUI renderers** — `ledger_add` calls now render inline with a styled preview (`✓ Saved "entry-name": first line...`) in the conversation. Shows the full entry body when expanded.
- **Write-lock reentrancy detection** — nested calls to `saveLedgerEntry` now throw an explicit error instead of silently corrupting the serialization chain.

### Changed

- **Frame-based spawn scheduler** — replaced the microtask-per-event render model with a scheduler that batches expensive component work at ~30 FPS. High-frequency streaming events (50–100+/sec) accumulate state cheaply per-event; layout, cache invalidation, and TUI invalidates are deferred to the next frame tick. Eliminates UI jank during bursty LLM streaming in child sessions.
- **ESM module type** — added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` for compatibility with strict ESM projects.

### Fixed

- **Stray ANSI reset codes in spawn shell** — `truncateToWidth` no longer injects escape sequences that break background color styling in collapsed spawn renderer borders and padding.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Microtask event batching** — rapid child session events are coalesced into a single parent invalidate per microtask boundary, preventing UI jank during bursty tool execution.
- **Epoch-based invalidation** — the spawn renderer uses epoch counters rather than pointer comparison to detect stale sessions, making ownership checks reliable across session resets.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

#### Context Management System Prompt

- **Automatic system-prompt injection** — the LLM receives a context management primer at session start, teaching it how and when to use spawn, ledger, and handoff. No configuration needed.
- **Live ledger listing in system prompt** — each session start injects the current ledger entries (name + first-line preview) so the agent always knows what stored knowledge is available without fetching blindly.

#### Spawn — Isolate Subtasks in Clean Child Contexts

- **`spawn` tool** — delegate isolated work to an in-memory child agent with its own clean context. The child inherits the parent's model, thinking level, working directory, and built-in tools. Only the condensed result is returned — no context pollution in the parent.
- **Parallel execution** — siblings run concurrently; the parent orchestrates and merges results. Tested for independent concurrent spawns producing correct results.
- **Child tool inheritance** — children receive ledger tools (add/get/list) and the parent's built-in tools, but never the spawn or handoff tools, preventing recursive nesting.
- **Ledger-aware child prompts** — child sessions are told what ledger entries exist so they can fetch knowledge on demand without the parent pre-loading bodies.
- **Child output truncation** — child results are limited to 2000 lines / 50KB to prevent runaway output from overwhelming the parent. Truncated results include an advisory message.
- **Explicit model-required error** — spawn fails immediately with a clear message when no model is configured, rather than with a cryptic runtime error.
- **No grandchildren** — children cannot spawn further children, preventing explosive branching.
- **Session lifecycle management** — children are properly cleaned up on completion, error, or parent session reset. Aborted children produce explicit `aborted` outcomes.
- **Signal-based cancellation** — spawn respects AbortSignal, allowing the parent to cancel a running child mid-flight.

#### Ledger — Sparse Continuity Cache

- **`ledger_add` tool** — save a named, compact continuity entry. Same-name writes overwrite (refinement). Writes are serialized via a process-local lock, preventing race conditions.
- **`ledger_get` tool** — retrieve a full entry body by name. Returns the current entry listing alongside the body. Reports "not found" gracefully with the complete entry list.
- **`ledger_list` tool** — list all entries with name and first-line preview. Returns empty-state placeholder when no entries exist.
- **Persistence across sessions** — ledger entries survive context resets, handoffs, and session restarts. On session start, the extension scans the session history newest-to-oldest and rehydrates the in-memory ledger from the latest epoch.
- **Ledger entry persistence via custom entries** — each `ledger_add` appends a versioned custom entry that survives compaction and session archival.
- **Epoch-based staleness** — child ledger tools reject access with a clear "invalidated by reset" error when the parent session has been reset, preventing stale writes.

#### Handoff — Deliberate Context Compaction

- **`handoff` tool** — triggers a deliberate compaction that replaces noisy context with a clean restart. The agent drafts a handoff brief preserving knowledge still missing from the ledger, then the session restarts with the brief at the top of context.
- **`/handoff` command** — user-facing shortcut that asks the agent to draft a handoff brief from a user direction, capture reusable state to the ledger, and call the handoff tool — all in one turn.
- **Rich compaction summary** — the handoff brief includes inlined ledger entries referenced in the task text (up to 3 entries, 4000 chars total), and a structured handoff primer explaining the continuation contract.
- **Clean slot handoff** — compaction replaces all pre-handoff messages with just the handoff summary. Full history remains in the session file for later reference.
- **Post-handoff auto-resume** — the agent receives a "Proceed." message after compaction completes, keeping momentum without manual re-prompt.
- **Enforcement tracking** — the `/handoff` command tracks whether the agent actually called the tool, preventing the command from being silently ignored. The watchdog cleans up stale enforcement state.

#### Primacy-Zone Watchdog

- **Advisory context-usage reminders** — a `context` hook injects a watchdog message before each LLM call when context usage exceeds 30%, 50%, or 70%. The message is advisory only — the agent decides whether to act.
- **Tiered nudge messages** — at 30-50% the agent is reminded of the primacy-zone heuristic; at 50-70% it's advised to consider handoff soon; at 70%+ it's warned that automatic compaction may trigger soon.
- **Hidden from user** — watchdog messages use a `custom` role with `display: false`, so they inform the LLM without cluttering the visible conversation.
- **`agent_end` tracking** — the watchdog records the latest context usage percent after each agent run, available for diagnostic use.

#### TUI and Status Indicators

- **Context usage in status bar** — a live `ctx 65%` indicator in the TUI status bar, color-coded: green (<30%), yellow (30-50%), orange (50-70%), red (≥70%).
- **Ledger count indicator** — a 📒 `N` badge in the status bar showing the number of ledger entries, hidden when the ledger is empty.
- **`/ledger` command** — shows all ledger entries with name, line count, and first-line preview in a TUI notification overlay.
- **Live spawn rendering** — child agent sessions render inside the parent's TUI with:
  - **Collapsed view**: model name, thinking level, real-time "last action" summary (thinking, tool execution, or assistant text preview), 5-line preview of last assistant output, and token/cost statistics.
  - **Expanded view**: full chat history with 4-space indent, streaming assistant messages, and tool execution components.
  - **Ownership lifecycle**: session ownership transfers from state to the renderer on first render, with proper cleanup on dispose, reset, or reattachment.
- **Render caching** — rendered output is cached by width/expanded/showImages, avoiding unnecessary re-renders when inputs haven't changed.
- **Graceful degradation** — the spawn renderer recovers from malformed events, missing tool definitions, subscribe failures, and null results without crashing the parent TUI.

#### Extension Wiring and Lifecycle

- **Single state object** — all primitives read/write through a single `AgenticodingState` instance, shared across extension hooks, tool executions, and the TUI renderer.
- **Session lifecycle hooks**:
  - `before_agent_start` — injects context primer and ledger listing.
  - `context` — injects watchdog reminders before LLM calls.
  - `session_start` — rehydrates ledger on continuation; resets state on `/new`.
  - `turn_end` — updates TUI indicators.
  - `agent_end` — records context usage and manages handoff enforcement.
  - `session_before_compact` — consumes pending handoff task as the compaction summary.
- **One-line install** — install via `pi install npm:pi-agenticoding` and disable platform compaction in settings.
- **Comprehensive test suite** — 50+ tests covering spawn execution and rendering (concurrency, cancellation, truncation, stale detection, ownership lifecycle, microtask batching), ledger tools (add/get/list, staleness, rehydration, empty states, prompt hints), handoff (tool, command, compaction), watchdog (nudge injection, enforcement), and extension lifecycle.
